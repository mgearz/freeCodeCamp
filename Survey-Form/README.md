Challenge 1: Create an HTML Survey Form

This project is the first challenge in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course. This means it was done flying solo with no help from fcc. I had to rely on notes and a Google a couple times.

It's not 100% perfect, CSS style wise, but I think it was a good first attempt at creating a form from scratch. I'm sure in future lessons I'll learn how to properly style and position all the various form elements (text input, radio buttons, dropdowns, checkboxes, etc.).

This challenge, built upon the foundations I've learned (concurrently) with The Odin Project, focusing on HTML Forms, styled with CSS.
