Challenge 3: Build a Technical Documentation Page

This project is the third challenge in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course. This means it was done flying solo with no help from fcc. I had to rely on notes and Google a couple times.

For this project, I needed to build a technical documentation app for a subject of my choosing. I decided to create a page covering the File Naming Conventions for Plex Media Servers, something I use myself. Kinda like having my own "personal Netflix" that's content agnostic. Any studio, never "expires". The reason I chose this subject was to use as a resource for myself when saving files for less common topics ("Extra Features"), it can be trickier to remember the options available.

I've come a long way already and I think I was able to match the overall layout pretty close to the [desired example](https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks/).

This was great practice to reinforce a lot of core principles while bringing in the responsiveness aspect with Media Queries.
