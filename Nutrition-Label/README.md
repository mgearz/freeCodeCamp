Lesson 7: Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label -
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-typography-by-building-a-nutrition-label)

This project is the seventh lesson in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course.

In this lesson, I learned the basics of typography (styling text to be easily readable and to suit its purpose). I used these typographic skills to build a nutrition label webpage (similar to what you'd see on the side of food packaging).

CSS:
    - span classes
    - float property
    - clear
    - dividers
    - box-sizing: border-box;
    - letter-spacing
    - text-indent
    - italicize <i>
