[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-css-flexbox-by-building-a-photo-gallery)

This project is the sixth lesson in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course.

In this lesson, I learned the basics of CSS Flexbox, as well as a few customization properties, as I made a simple photo gallery for cat pics.

CSS:
    - Flexbox:
        - flex-direction
        - flex-wrap
        - justify-content
        - align-items
    - Img Properties:
        - object-fit: cover;
    - @media queries
