[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-responsive-web-design-by-building-a-piano)

This project is the eleventh lesson in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course.

In this lesson, we used CSS and Responsive Design to code a piano. I also continued learning more about media queries and pseudo selectors.

CSS:
    - Psuedo-selectors
        - ::before
        - ::after
    - content property
        - content: ""
    - Responsive Design
        - overflow: hidden
        - @media queries
