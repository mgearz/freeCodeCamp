Challenge 2: Create a Tribute Page

This project is the second challenge in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course. This means it was done flying solo with no help from fcc. I had to rely on notes and Google a couple times.

For this project, I needed to build a tribute page for a subject of my choosing. I decided to create a page for one of my favorite film directors, Tim Burton. I've always enjoyed his dark, but playful, artistic style.

I've come a long way already and I think I was able to match the overall layout pretty close to the [desired example](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/).

I then customized it further to try and pay homage to Burton's style; integrating a custom tiled background and a [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Aboreto?query=Aboreto&category=Serif,Display&preview.text=Tim%20Burton&preview.text_type=custom) that I thought matched pretty well.
