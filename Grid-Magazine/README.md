Lesson 13: Learn CSS Grid by Building a Magazine -
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-css-grid-by-building-a-magazine)

This project is the thirteenth lesson in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course.

In this lesson, we used CSS Grid to make a Responsive Magazine Layout. It was interesting to see how it worked in comparison to the previous technique we learned, Flexbox. I'll definitely seek additional material about "CSS Grid" on YouTube and The Odin Project to help solidify my understanding of it.
