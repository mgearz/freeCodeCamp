[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-intermediate-css-by-building-a-picasso-painting)

This project is the tenth lesson in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course.

In this lesson, I learned how to use some intermediate CSS techniques by coding a Picasso painting webpage. I also learned about SVG icons, CSS positioning, and reviewed other CSS skills I've learned.

HTML:
    - SVG Icons (via FontAwesome)
        - call using <i> element, style in CSS

CSS:
    - position property (absolute)
        - top, right, bottom, left
        - z-index (layers)
