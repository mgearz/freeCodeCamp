Lesson 8: Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz -
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-accessibility-by-building-a-quiz)

This project is the eighth lesson in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course.

In this lesson, I learned some best practices in making code accessible for all users. I used these principles to build a basic quiz using forms.

HTML:
    - accesskey attribute
    - forms (section, fieldset, legend, label, input types, ul, li)
    - <span class="sr-only"> (text only visible to screen-readers)
    - auto-scroll to section navigation

CSS:
    - scroll-behavior: smooth; (and making it a media query)
    - .sr-only (screen-reader only and preferred settings)
