[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-more-about-css-pseudo-selectors-by-building-a-balance-sheet)

This project is the ninth lesson in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course.

In this lesson, I learned all about using different psuedo-selectors to style an HTML table (a balance sheet).

HTML:
    - aria-hidden attribute (hides non-interactive content for accessibility)
    - <table> Element
        - <caption>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, <tr>, <th>, <td>

CSS:
    - span[class~="class-name"] selector
    - span[class] selector
    - :first-of-type, :last-of-type, & :nth-of-type() selectors
    - :not() psuedo-selector
    - [attribute="value"] selector
    - clip and clip-path properties
    - position property (sticky, static, relative, absolute, fixed)
    - calc() function
    - !important rule
