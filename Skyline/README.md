[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-css-variables-by-building-a-city-skyline)

This project is the twelfth lesson in freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" Course.

In this lesson, we used learned about CSS Variable to make a Responsive City Skyline design. At above 1000px displays, the skyline is vibrantly colored with a bright sunny sky. But when you scale the display down to below 1000px, the sky turns to night and all the buildings become shadowed out.

CSS:
    - CSS Variables
        - :root selector
        - in combination with @media queries
    - Gradients
        - linear-gradient
        - repeating-linear-gradient
        - radial-gradient
            - circle closest-corner at X% X%
